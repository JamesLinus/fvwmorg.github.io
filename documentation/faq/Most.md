The most frequently asked questions
===================================

#### A few minutes after fvwm is started my keyboard and mouse bindings stop working.  What can I do?

  Probably your NumLock, CapsLock or ScrollLock key is pressed.  See
  Q 5.5 for more details.

  Trivia: In all my years as an fvwm developer this has been by far the
  most frequently asked question.  Whoever can solve this problem so
  that this question is never asked again will be mentioned in big
  letters on the fvwm home page :-)


#### I use XMMS, but it ignores some window styles.

  XMMS wants to do everything by itself and overrides many
  settings of the window manager.  Check the options menu in XMMS
  and if that does not help, ask the XMMS people about it at

        http://xmms.org/

  *Please* do not ask XMMS questions on the fvwm mailing lists
  and do not report XMMS related bugs before you tried the XMMS
  mailing lists.  No offense meant, but we really have more
  important things to do than providing user support for third
  party software.

#### I like transparency.  What can I do?

  See questions 3.23, 3.24, 3.25, 3.26 that deal with transparency.

  Also see configurations supplied in fvwm-themes package, some
  themes use transparent menus, modules and/or decorations.  E.g.:
