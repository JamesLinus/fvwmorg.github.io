## <a name="irc"></a>IRC Channels

Several IRC channels are also available to discuss fvwm related
topics or to get help.  They are not official in a sense that the
fvwm developers maintain them, but there is a chance to meet some
of the developers there:

  + `#fvwm` on freenode
  + `+fvwm.de` on IRCnet (German channel)
