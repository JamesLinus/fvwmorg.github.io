	  My desktop shows (of course) fvwm,
	  of which not much is being seen actually.
	  Only the root menu and the decorations are really fvwm-like.
	  I like gtk so I am using gnome's panels (top and bottom, left hand side).
	  There's an aterm window using transparency, gqmpeg and netscape, and, of
	  course, gkrellm running.
	  For the colors, I used grdb and grdb2fvwm, which takes gnome's colors
	  and fonts and puts it into my fvwm2rc. it's quite useful, I think.

	  This screenshot shows fvwm 2.5.5 (from cvs) with a lot of transparency.
	  Title bars, borders, menues and pagers (invisible at the moment) are all fully 
	  transparent, some are shaded to look blueish. Besides fvwm2, you see my logs 
	  in three aterms on the right side of the screen. Below that xchat and a small
	  gkrellm. On the left, there's mutt in an Eterm. The nice background is done
	  by xplanet and refreshed every 15 minutes.

Basically, my configuration is taken from <a href="http://pemarchandet.free.fr/">here</a> that
I customized to my likes. Transparent window titles for inactive windows.
Small vertical pager. Possibility to roll a window to its window title (on
the left in my case). Transparent menus (doesn't show on the
screenshot). There are also two applications which are transparent and
sticky so that they look like they are on the root window (your idea!).
Those applications are on the bottom left (a slide show with 2 xbiffs)
and the other one on the right, with the time, various widgets and
action buttons. This app is named a Crocbar, and written in Java. (but
lightweight, yes, yes). But that's not part of FVWM. Yet, it's a
neat way to have something that looks like a FvwmButtons module or
dock.<br /><br />

hover-windowbuttons, rounded corners and a buttonwidth that's different
from the decorations height.

This screenshot is intended to show the versatility of FvwmButtons.
FvwmButtons can swallow programs as well as menu items.  There are 3
separate FvwmButton panels active on this desktop.  MyBar1 is the
button on the right, and runs xbuffy, which monitors my incoming mail.
MyBar2, the bar across the bottom contains menu items and the
FvwmPager.  I have 24 active desktops.  The labeling, F1, F2,
etc. tells me which key combination to hit to go to that desktop.
MyBar3, which takes up the bulk of the screen, holds several programs
I constantly run and need quick access to.  All 3 bars are easily
iconized and removed from the screen with a simple key stroke designed
specifically for that individual bar, leaving me a clean and open
desktop to run additional programs.

This screenshot demonstrates the WindowShade feature.
Instead of using icons, you can scroll the window up into
the titlebar.
The left buttons on the titlebar are created using vectors.
The right buttons are pixmaps.
All the buttons are user definable which further demonstrates
FVWM's flexibility.

	  arrays when pressed.
	  Menus and title bars are lightly gradiented and the (vector) titlebar
	  buttons were stolen from an old post to the fvwm mailing list. What

	  mutt (mail reader), switch between windows and desks, etc.

	  This is my current favorite fvwm theme. The buttons and gradients
	  are based on an E fvwm theme which I thought looked quite spiffy.
	  As you can see I'm playing with FvwmButtons and FvwmTheme. I'm
	  never totally happy with what I come up with so this current
	  one has probably changed since this shot was taken.

The basic rules guiding this @fvwm2rc@:
<ul>
<li>
 Modal interfaces are evil.
<li>
 No icons will ever appear on any system I run.  
<li>
 Nothing ever gets dragged, nothing ever gets dropped.
<li>
 There will be no system controls which are bound to or only
 accessible via particular locations on the screen.
<li>
 Key bindings/keyboard acceleration is your friend.
<li>
 No Z-order limits on any controls or feature accessibility.
<li>
 All controls must be accessible and controllable without
 requiring prior access (such as by changing z-order or moving a
 window out of the way (BAD!)), or to any other particular window
 or X or WM widget or device.
</ul>

This is a screen shot of fvwm mimicking the cde environment.
The setup features motif-style window decorations and
shadow/hilight color calculations.  The colors are calculated in
a perl script, which also generates .xresources and .gtkrc files
so that a consistent color scheme is used throughout all
applications.  In addition, given background pixmaps are colored
in the same colors, who on turn are reflected in the colors of
the buttons on the pager.  To mimic the cde front panel (in the
bottom) I used the gnome panel with some custom applets added.
Left to be done to fully get the cde look are window decorations
for icons. 
You can dowload
CDEmu which includes config files and scripts

The setup is like this: FVWM 2.5.7 on a Red Hat 9 box (PIII 500Mhz). I
like the interface to be as simple as possible without losing
functionality. GKrellm, a simple pager, a menu, application windows and
icons. That's it.<br>
Things I would
like to add is some eye-candy (transparancy) and finally get
FvwmTrackFocus.pl working :-) but on the whole I think this setup is nice
to work with.

it's simple (no transparent

contrast to all the "walk and talk" .fvwm2rc's out there. It does have
custom pixmaps buttons and titlebar, along with FvwmButtons on the
taskbar...
I'd like
to combine the maximize and restore buttons into one.

The question mark button brings up a form containing choices for all the

I used FVWM to create my own desktop enviroment. It's called
'FVWM - Crystal' and it's based on the unstable/CVS branch (2.5.6). It's features
include:

<ul>
<li>transparent panels/window titles</li>
<li>intensive use of mouse buttons; normal is using 2 buttons to make
  different tasks, usually all three are used</li>
<li>new look at user interface, for example close/minimize/kill functions
  are combined in one title-bar button; there are two modes of moving or
  maximizing a window; interface is clean and provides a lot of space on
  the desktop - all panels can be hid by just middle-clicking on the
  desktop</li>
<li>intensive use of keyboard shortcuts (example: numpad, used to control
  windows - resizing, moving, shading, etc. - has 37 different
  shortcuts); there are keys to control window placement, moving windows
  between dekstops and resizing them; also included is control over xmms
  with additional programs</li>

tinted transparent menus, multipixmap titlebars, FvwmButtons on the
bottom that badly simulates the RedmondXP panel (it is managed by
fvwm module written in perl), icons tinted differently in menus,
shadow text and FreeType fonts. On the right is gkrellm.

<p>A similar configuration is availaible out of the box in fvwm-themes 0.7.0
or greater.

the bottom left corner and the icons appear/disappear when Super_L is
pressed/released.  Also, FvwmButtons is shown for a second or so when
the mouse pointer hits a screen edge.  Switching pages with EdgeScroll
still works.  All these tricks are possible with the new Schedule
command.  Finally, a window thumbnail used as its icon is produced
when the window has had focus for some time, not when it is being
iconified.  This makes FVWM feel more responsive.

I like a clean desktop. I created a gradient for my fvwm menu and I called
it  "ocean".  I used a blue  gradient  for the active  titlebar  and a grey
gradient for  inactive.  I  can  easily  switch between viewports  with
"alt+arrow". The icons are from <b>wm-icons</b>. You  can see in the top left
corner two tiny  fvwm buttons. The first is  to  hide/unhide zinf, the
audio player, the second is a "swallow" of  my jabber status. Clicking
on it hides/unhides the psi main window.

I put xplanet in the backround with tracking of some satellites. (you
can see ISS  and XMM). On   the right, this   is gkrellm and a  sticky
transprent aterm in the bottom. Only 3 lines, it's just to launch some
commands.

When I minimize an application, the icon is  sent to my vertical icon
box,  just under grkrellm,  but  I do it rarely.  I  prefer shading of
windows, like the xterm at the top of the screen.

I just discovered today the cool "Aqua" skin for GTK and the "Aqua" skin
for phoenix, my favourite browser.

I documented a lot my
@fvwm2rc@ file, but in french...

Yes, I hate taskbars and icons ! ;)

A Flat look, using vector buttons with solid color, loosely based on
a fluxbox look with wallpaper from QNX. The icons are from the wm-icons
package, and theres a transparent pager in the top left. Running fvwm-2.5.5

Tavis: They are generated automatically, the icons are little screenshots of
the windows before they were iconified, pretty simple to do with the new
WindowStyle command, but they look really cool :)

	  Here's my latest screenshot running FVWM 2.2.4 under RedHat Linux 6.2.  I
	  have a light marble GTK+ theme that I've extended manually onto my FVWM
	  buttons, and a custom icon or two.  I made the blue Vampire Princess Miyu
	  background for the Eterm, and threw Vampire Princess Miyu skins that I
	  found onto Licq and xmms.  I also customized the title bars a bit with a
	  textured background that fits in with the overall blueness of the Miyu

This screenshot shows FVWM running with a modified fvwm-themes (mostly
stolen from 'default'). I have tried to emulate the look and feel of RH's
"AnotherLevel", by changing the window colour, and centering the title of
the windows.<br>

The icons and the panel that you can see are a customised version of
<a href="http://rox.sf.net">Rox-Filer</a> that complements FVWM extremely well.

This setup uses an old style - very similar to that of MWM and CDE.  The
window colors can be changed on-the-fly using a dynamic menu of defined
colorsets, although the inactive colorset is always 'skyblue3'.  The
buttonsbar at the bottom is FvwmButtons which has swallowed xbuffy, rxvt, a
"media panel" (to control mpc), xlassie, two instances of xloadtime, and
FvwmPager.  The whole this is panelised so that it is retractable.  I also
have a root menu which has acccess to some common programs I like to use. 
There are some keybindings to toggle features as well.<br>
