FVWM is an extremely customizable window manager. A FVWM Theme will
consist of a config file, and a collection additional resources
(images, scripts, audio files, etc). Some aspects of a theme may
require additional software (system monintors, system tray, etc)
to function.

There are some prebuilt themes for FVWM, such as
[Fvwm Themes](http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/).
