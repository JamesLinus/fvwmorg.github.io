## Other FVWM-related sites

Here are some other sites (besides the
[offical]({{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
one) that have FVWM info:

  + [The FVWM Wiki Pages](http://fvwmforums.org/wiki/):
    A shared collection of FVWM releated stuff.
  + [The FVWM Forums](http://fvwmforums.org/phpBB3/):
    Acollection of user questions and answers.
  + [Suzanne Skinner's FVWM site](http://ironphoenix.org/tril/fvwm/configs/):
    Stylish screenshots (and config files) from the author of the
    MultiPixmap titlebar feature. Don't miss her thoughtful and
    entertaining essay
    "[My Quest for the Perfect Window Manager](http://ironphoenix.org/tril/fvwm/)."
    (*The hobbit in us would like to subtitle it "There and Back Again".*)
  + [Dorothy Robinson's FVWM 2.6 Decors](http://www.twobarleycorns.net/fvwm-decors.html):
    An impressive collection of window decors showing off FVWM 2.6's
    visual versatility. All the config files are downloadable.

## Themes

  + [The Offical FVWM Themes Home Page](http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/):
    Highly recommended for novice user. FVWM Themes provides a powerful
    gui-driven theme engine and a wide variety of preconfigured themes so you
    can get started without having to learn anything about FVWM configuration
    commands. If the supplied themes don't suit you, you can create your own,
    or mix and match components from the existing ones.
    The site also has links to other theme related sites.
  + [The Window Manger Icons Project](http://wm-icons.sourceforge.net/):
    An efficent icon distribution to use with fvwm and fvwm-themes.
  + [FVWM Decorations](http://www.xwinman.org/fvwm.php):
    Some screenshots and config files.

## ICCCM

If you want to know why FVWM does some of the things it does (or if you just want
to see if we're really behaving properly!), you can peruse the online version of
the ICCCM:
