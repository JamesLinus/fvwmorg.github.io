## Other FVWM-related sites

Here are some other sites (besides the
[official]({{ "/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
one) that have FVWM info:

    A shared collection of FVWM related stuff.

    A short article on why FVWM is best configured by a text-based config file.
  + [FVWM and Session Management](http://linuxgazette.net/100/adam.html):
    An article on how to use session management with FVWM. Note the info
    about Gnome-Session is outdated, but xsm(1) is still an option.

to see if we're really behaving properly!), you can peruse the online version of
the ICCCM:
